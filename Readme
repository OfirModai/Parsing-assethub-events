AssetHub Event Parser Example

This project demonstrates how to parse events from a specific block on AssetHub. The example focuses on block 9520865, but you can modify it to use other blocks as needed.

Setup

Before running the project, you need to properly configure your node connection and authentication token. Open:

/src/our_rpc_client.rs

and set your values around line 33:

pub const NODE_URL: &str = ""; // Enter your node URL here
pub const TOKEN: &str = ""; // Enter your token here

Make sure both fields are filled; otherwise, the parser will not work correctly.

Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-directory>

Configure your node and token in /src/our_rpc_client.rs as described above.

Build and run the project:
cargo run

The parser will fetch and process events from the specified block, printing relevant details to the console.
